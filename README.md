# High impedance RF probes #

This repository contains a bunch of designs based on the Elektor "Poor Man's 1-GHz Active Probe":

* Elektor 1GHz RF Probe.brd - the original PCB design on which the others are based.
* Buffered 1GHz RF Probe.brd - the Elektor design, modified by myself to add an MAR-6 buffer to try and remove the -20dB probe attenuation.
* Buffered 1GHz RF Probe SMA.brd - same as above, but with an SMA connector for the RF output.

Refer to the Elektor article "Poor Man's 1-GHz Active Probe" in the October 2004 issue of Elektor for more information.
